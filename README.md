Building both a dashboard and a film recommendation algorithm for a fictionnal cinema in a remote area in France.
Our team gathered the movies information on TMBD and IMDB. I added socio-demographic data and generic data on cinema in France (CNC).

The datavisusaliations were built with Python using Seaborn and Plotly. 
I personnally worked on 
  - the socio-demographic data and visusalisations
  - the cinema data in France and visulisations
  - the genres (top movie per genre, top 5 genres and best genres per dacades)

The algorithm was done in Python using the k-neighbors classifier model from SciKitLearn.

The interface for both the dashboard and the film recommendation algorithm were done on Streamlit. I created the base and a member of the team finished designing and building the page.
